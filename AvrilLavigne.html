       She is considered a key musician in the development of pop punk music, 
       
       since she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music in the early 2000s.

       became Lavigne's first album to reach the top of the 
        
       Billboard 200 chart in the United States, going on to sell 10 million copies worldwide.

        reached number one in seven countries worldwide 
        
       and saw the international success of its lead 
        
       single <i>Girlfriend</i>,

       United States. Her next two studio albums,
